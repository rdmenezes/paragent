=== My Remote Desktop Window Is Too Small ===

From a user: 
 I found something else out.  After I got it working correctly I went about my day as usual.  
 I then needed to remote to a  pc.  I clicked on remote and had the same trouble.  The remote 
 window was way too small to use. I then right clicked the remote link and opened it in a new 
 tab versus a new window.  I have tried this multiple times and it works.  I guess IE7 works 
 better with less windows opened.  Or at least it works better with java. So if anyone else has 
 this issue you might try telling them to open it in a new tab versus a new window.
